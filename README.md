# ApnaCollegeDSA
A place where I store all the word I did and still do during my time at the Apna College DSA Course.

- **FlowchartsAndPseudocode:** This was not a part of DSA or Java in any way. It was a way for me to regain some concepts to help me represent my solutions in a more understandable way.

- **VariablesAndDatatypes:** Learnt how java is statically typed languages, it's data types, type convertion and casting. Type promotion in expressions.

- **Operators:** Learnt how to work with various operators such as arithmetic, assignment, relational, logical and learnt about operator precedence and associativity.

- **Conditionals:** Learnt about how to work with the if-else, else-if ladder, switch-case statements for condition matching in java.

- **Loops:** Learnt about the for, while, do-while, break, continue constructs available for iteration in java.
